\description{
Easy to use functions for fitting selected GARCH-type models from
the widely-known \code{rugarch} package by Ghalanos (2024). These
functions are meant as an easy to use way to compare the main results from
\code{rugarch} to the newly established models in the \code{fEGarch} package
and are by no means considered to be a replacement of \code{rugarch}.
}
\details{
For most details, please see the documentation of the \code{rugarch} package
(Ghalanos, 2024).

These functions also provide an extension, so that a nonparametric,
smooth scale function in the unconditional standard deviation
can be estimated before the parametric step.
If \code{use_nonpar = TRUE},
\code{meanspec} is omitted and before fitting a zero-mean model in the
conditional volatility following the remaining function arguments, a smooth scale function,
i.e. a function representing the unconditional standard deviation over time,
is being estimated following the specifications in \code{nonparspec} and
\code{control_nonpar}. This preliminary step stabilizes the input
series \code{rt}, as long-term changes in the unconditional variance
are being estimated and removed before the parametric step using
\code{\link[smoots]{tsmooth}}. \code{control_nonpar} can be adjusted following
to make changes to the arguments of \code{\link[smoots]{tsmooth}}
for short-memory specifications. These arguments specify settings
for the automated bandwidth selection algorithms implemented by this
function. By default, we use the settings
\code{Mcf = "NP"}, \code{InfR = "Nai"},
\code{bStart = 0.15}, \code{bvc = "Y"}, \code{cb = 0.05}, and
\code{method = "lpr"} for \code{\link[smoots]{tsmooth}}.
\code{\link{locpol_spec}} passed to \code{nonparspec} handles
more direct settings of the local polynomial smoother itself. See
the documentation for these functions to get a detailed overview
of these settings. Assume \eqn{\{r_t\}} to be the observed series, where
\eqn{t = 1, 2, \dots, n},
then \eqn{r_t^{*} = r_t - \bar{r}}, with \eqn{\bar{r}} being the arithmetic
mean over the observed \eqn{r_t}, is computed and subsequently
\eqn{y_t = \ln\left[\left(r_t^{*}\right)^2\right]}. The subtraction of
\eqn{\bar{r}} is necessary so that \eqn{r_t^{*}} are all different from zero
almost surely. Once \eqn{y_t} are available, its trend \eqn{m(x_t)},
with \eqn{x_t} as the rescaled time on the interval \eqn{[0, 1]}, is
being estimated using
\code{\link[esemifar]{tsmoothlm}} and denoted here by
\eqn{\hat{m}(x_t)}. Then from \eqn{\hat{\xi}_t = y_t - \hat{m}(x_t)}
obtain \eqn{\hat{C} = -\ln\left\{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\exp\left(\hat{\xi}_t\right)\right\}},
and obtain the estimated scale function as
\eqn{\hat{s}(x_t)=\exp\left[\left(\hat{\mu}(x_t) - \hat{C}\right) / 2\right]}.
The stabilized / standardized version of the series \eqn{\left\{r_t\right\}}
is then \eqn{\tilde{r}_t = r_t^{*} / \hat{s}(x_t)}, to which
a purely parametric volatility model following the remaining function arguments
is then
fitted. The estimated volatility at a given time point is then
the product of the estimate of the corresponding scale function value
and of the estimated conditional standard deviation (following the parametric
model part) for that same time point. See for example Feng et al. (2022)
or Letmathe et al. (2023) for more information on the semiparametric extension
of volatility models.
